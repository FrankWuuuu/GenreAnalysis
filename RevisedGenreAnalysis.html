                            When Electronic music (EDM) entered the mainstream in the early 2010s, its sound design and instrumentation captivated listeners. Thus, artists established in the genre would focus on these aspects. Electronic artists perfected their craft in electronic sound design and innovated upon it to deepen genres or invent new ones within EDM.


                        </p>
                  
                        <p>
                          However, a strong emphasis on sound design meant a loss of emphasis on the linguistic side of music. Lyrics were often brought onto tracks not by the electronic artist but by outsourced songwriters and featured singers and only served to deliver the listener to the instrumental chorus of a song; little thought was put into the meanings or messages of the words. Additionally, focusing on deepening genres vertically meant there was little horizontal crossover between various genres.

                        </p>
                  
                        <p>
                            In the late 2010s, a new genre of indie electronic music sought to fill in these gaps. Most notably, artists such as Porter Robinson and Madeon brought a fresh approach to electronic music by combining traditional aspects of EDM with personal songwriting and genre-blending. Artists like Xavi, Former Hero, Phritz, and aCloudySkye followed suit. Singing with their own voices, often through altered vocal effects, these artists blended elements of various genres into EDM to create a more personal musical experience. Ultimately, this indie electronic genre is everything electronic music wasn’t while still maintaining everything electronic music is.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Good Faith</h2>
                        <p>
                            <i>Good Faith</i> by Madeon (Hugo Pierre Leclercq) was the first major project to emerge from this electronic music genre. Prior to the release of this album, Madeon and Porter Robinson (a friend and electronic artist) created the song “Shelter.” This was Leclercq’s first time carrying a song with his own vocals. He stated in an interview with MusicRadar that he wrote and sang “Shelter” “without the help of traditional writers,” and its success gave him the “confidence to write [<i>Good Faith</i>] alone” (29). Traditionally, if an electronic artist wanted vocals on their songs, they needed to outsource it to singers. Leclercq writing and singing his own lyrics subverts this convention. He opened the door for electronic artists to be songwriters for themselves, proving they didn’t need professional singing voices to convey personal messages through lyrics.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After “Shelter,” <i>Good Faith</i> was also the first major use of a distinctive effect that made vocals higher, more feminine, and more robotic. Leclercq was mainly a music producer and secondarily a singer. Masking his voice behind a highly processed vocal effect allowed him more comfortably convey his message without worrying about how it sounded. This is a convention that persisted throughout the genre, and future artists found additional uses for the technique.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Good Faith</i>'s biggest impact on the genre was pioneering the unique philosophy of genre blending that became a non-negotiable convention for this genre of music. Landon Fleury, a music critic, described it as a “massive blend of all of Madeon’s different influences,” including “disco, R&B, soul, jazz, pop, gospel, even a little bit of rock, and orchestral” (6:57). This is instantly apparent in <i>Good Faith’s</i> opening track, “Dream Dream Dream.” The song begins with a sample of a gospel choir, chopped and rearranged in a glitchy way.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The technique of chopping sounds is often used on solo vocals in EDM; thus it is familiar to EDM listeners. Leclercq’s application of this technique to gospel choir vocals creates a sound that is different but still familiar to EDM listeners. Leclercq further develops this genre-blending by contextualizing the gospel choir with supporting synthesizers or electronic drums. This blends the line between the music Leclercq is taking inspiration from and his basis in electronic music. Leclercq incorporates his love for other types of music by treating them like elements of electronic music and placing them in a context familiar to electronic listeners.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Nurture</h2>
                        <p>
                          Porter Robinson is a close friend and collaborator of Madeon’s, and his 2021 album <i>Nurture</i> took the torch from <i>Good Faith’s</i>. It solidified the genre by popularizing it and further developing the conventions Madeon set up. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          While Madeon established the altered feminine vocal as a tool for singing, Robinson expanded upon using altered feminine vocals, giving it narrative meaning. Robinson once explained the vocal effect, which he calls ‘digital falsetto’, often “represents a negative inner voice or an idealized version of [himself]”(4). While Good Faith’s subject matter mostly focused on love, Nurture is about Robinson’s struggle through depression and creative block, trying to make music he was proud of. He uses the altered vocal to represent the thoughts that held him back. In “Something Comforting,” Robinson starts in his regular voice, speaking of his creative struggles. He suddenly switches to the altered vocals, telling himself, “getting made you want more, hurting made you hurt more [...] there must be something wrong with me”(5-8).

                        <p>
                          This is Robinson’s inner voice speaking his fears. “Getting made” refers to the success of his iconic previous album, <i>Worlds</i>. His inner voice tells him his attempt to one-up its legacy and failed hope to make music has broken him mentally. Robinson uses the altered vocal to separate these harmful thoughts from himself. At the end of the song, the same chorus is repeated, glitching between Robinson’s normal and altered voices.


                        </p>
                        <audio controls>

                        <p>
                             Robinson’s duet with himself demonstrates while the messages of each voice are different from each other, they are both parts of him. While one voice may be harmful and untrue, these thoughts are also real and relatable. With this moment, Robinson explores, for the first time, potential symbolisms in the relationship between the altered voice effect Madeon created and the singer’s chest voice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Robinson also implements the genre-blending philosophy Madeon introduced. Landon Fleury, in a review of <i>Nurture</i>, described that “Porter seems to be borrowing” from “Hugo's approach to his influences,” taking “so many different styles and [blending] them together in a way that felt unique to him” (6:42). Throughout the album, there are Jpop-inspired guitar ballads, electro-house piano breakdowns, electropop vocals, Eurodance basslines, anime & video game soundtrack elements, and indie-folk-inspired songwriting. All of these elements are woven into the structure of electronic music. The genres Robinson pulled from were very different from Madeon’s. By using the same method with different genres to create completely different worlds of music, Porter solidified the genre-blending convention as a method and philosophy, not an outcome.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">To the Endless Searing Skies</h2>
                        <p>
                            Xavi’s <i>To the Endless Searing Skies</i> is an example of a smaller artist inspired by the work of Madeon and Robinson, and adopting the genre’s approaches to music. He implements the genre’s approach to genre-blending, however, with a more electronic palette of genres. Music journalist Oliver Tryon describes that the album “projects a mix of Porter Robinson and Madeon” and combines inspirations from “synthpop, electropop, indie, future bass, midtempo and melodic dubstep” (1-2). This is apparent in “Random Acts of Collision.” Its chorus contains a wobbly bass from the electronic genre future bass, its verse is inspired by ambient piano music, and its pre-chorus is supported by a gospel choir sample similar to Madeon’s. 
                        </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Sadak_in_Search_of_the_Waters_of_Oblivion.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted"> John Martin’s Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion</span>
                        <p>
                            Xavi also pushes the boundaries of the genre-blending convention by taking inspiration from genres that aren’t even musical. Xavi cited romantic era paintings as a major influence on his music. The final track of his album, “Sadak (In Search of the Waters),” is the musical representation of John Martin’s Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion. This painting tells the story of a man (Sadak) climbing a mountain, fighting nature to reach his goal (to find the waters of oblivion). In the same way that this genre recontextualizes other musical genres into EDM, Xavi recontextualizes John Martin’s painting through EDM techniques. The bloody red atmosphere is replicated with harsh synth chords, and the contrasting fluttery piano mirrors the glimmer of light radiating from the top of the painting. The instrumentation slowly builds in energy, representing Sadak’s slow climb up the mountain.

                        <p>
                            Xavi uses the imagery of Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion to relate to his own struggles. Singing about his uncertainty for the future, he says, “if all I see is red, and endless mountains up ahead, will you be worth it?”(13-14). Throughout the song, Xavi reveals his struggles to achieve his personal musical goals, his ‘waters of oblivion’. Scared that life may pass him by, he questions if relationships hold him back from achieving these goals. He paints these struggles as the endless red mountains Sadak faces in the painting. While Xavi is very cryptic with his words, he uses Sadak to convey his struggle to find success in music.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While Robinson and Madeons’ use of the feminine vocal effect was smooth and elegant, Xavi’s implementation is much grittier. This makes his vocals comparable to the sound of a vocoder (a common EDM element). This increases familiarity for electronic listeners and matches the sonic tone of the album. Specifically, in “Sadak (In Search of the Waters),” the harshness of the vocals mirrors the hellish rocky imagery of the painting. This reinforces the feeling of dread and struggle Xavi conveys in his lyrics and instrumentation. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                          These three albums may not resemble eachother sonically – some might not recongize them as being related at first glance– but they highlight a shared approach to electronic music. They pull inspiration from vastly different worlds of music, creating palletes that conjure different moods to support different emotions. However these palletes of inspiration represent each artist’s personal collection of tastes, like a fingerprint of their musical identity. Similarly, while each artist learned to songwrite differently from each other, and write about completely different subjects, they share a core of genuinity. Their lyrics vocalize personal experiences and sentiments, bringing this side of lyricism to EDM. The indie electronic genre has proven that there are many other avenues to explore in electronic music outside of sound design, and that exploring these avenues can result in much more unique, personal creations.
