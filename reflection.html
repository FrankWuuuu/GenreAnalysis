                            The modes of the texts are auditory and linguistic. The genre’s relatively high focus on songwriting and lyricism as an EDM genre gave the composers a lot of room to work in the linguistic side. This affordance gives the composer the opportunity to dive deep into the messages they want to express through words and metaphors. However, writing lyrics is much harder than writing sentences because the composer has to deal with melodies rhythms and rhyming. This can constrict the composer’s freedom to say what they want, but this affordance is more a difficulty than an impossibility (the composer can probably find a lyric that works eventually, even if it's difficult). The composer, as a music producer, also has a lot of freedom in the auditory mode. Since electronic music is all about experimentation, the composer has the freedom to put any sound they want into their music as long as it supports their purpose. The composer has all the tools of music- melodies, chords, rhythms, percussion, foley, synths, organic instruments, audio effects like distortion reverb and equalizers, vocals, and more- to create an atmosphere around their lyrics. This freedom allows the composer to support the message in their lyrics in very creative ways.

                            I was also worried I didn’t incorporate conventions explicitly enough. I spoke about multiple conventions specifically but did not necessarily explicitly call them negotiable/ non-negotiable conventions as they appeared through each sample. However, I feel that I covered each convention very specifically, even though I didn’t always call them conventions.

                            I was not sure if I could focus on just a single song for everything I wanted to talk to. Taking an album as a whole and analyzing each song it it was too much content to manage. However, some songs demonstrated conventions better than others, and sometimes a single song was not holistic enough to encapsulate everything. I decided to compromise by speaking about albums as a unit first, talking about overall trends and features of the album, then narrowing down on specific songs or parts of songs. This allowed me to explain my ideas more neatly.

                            I am dissatisfied with the way I explained genre-blending for the second and third samples. I wish I could have had more word count and time to flesh out the explanations of the various inspirations each album had. I was only able to list examples or speak of them more generally.  With more time, I could have also cut out more audio samples from the songs to include in the website, demonstrating the range of genres these albums pulled from. While I think I delivered the point that the genre uses genre-blending to create unique combinations creating very different results, I could have gone more in-depth in the second and third samples the way I did for the first.
